# Code Refactor Starter Code
Site is published at: https://andcooke.github.io/challenge-1/

For this exercise, we were told to clean up pre-made HTML and CSS code. 

I have done the following:
    -supplied alt text for the images 
    -changed non-semantic elements to semantic elements
    -simplified repetitive css code
